# AudioQaida
first open source free audio qaida for all muslims children around the world
Welcome to the Audio Qur'an for Children project! We are creating a free, open-source audio Qur'an specifically designed for children to learn and recite.

Our goal is to provide an accessible and engaging way for children to learn and recite the Qur'an, and we need your help to make it a reality. Whether you are a Qaida teacher, an audio engineer, or just want to contribute in any way you can, we welcome your contributions and support.

There are many ways you can help:

Record and submit audio recordings of Qaida Chapter or Letter's
Help with audio editing and production
Contribute to the project's documentation and resources
Spread the word about the project to your community and networks
If you are interested in helping, please reach out to us through the project's GitHub issues or contact us through the email address provided in the repository. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of children and help them grow in their love and understanding of the Qur'an , and qaida. Thank you for your support!
